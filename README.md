## Introduction

This project was developed as part of my Summer Internship during the 7th semester of my Bachelor's in IT Engineering (B.E.) program. It's a collection of mini-games designed to showcase various aspects of mobile app development.


Through this mini project, I aim to demonstrate my skills in creating interactive and entertaining mobile applications for Android devices. Each mini-game included here represents a unique challenge, offering a glimpse into the world of app development.


MyGames is a collection of simple and fun mini-games for Android. It was developed as a project for a college course and showcases different game mechanics and concepts. The app is designed to be lightweight, easy to use, and enjoyable for users of all ages.
